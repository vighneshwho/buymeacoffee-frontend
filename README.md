# BuyMeACoffee-FrontEnd

A small user management page built on top of the [GoRest API](https://gorest.co.in/) for [buymeacoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/)

The lnding page has a lot of smart micro interactions which helps to grab the user's attention throughout the page. I've used AnimeJs timelines for most of the animations. 

Additionally there is also a /users route with which any client can View, Add, Delete and Edit the list of users from the GoRest API

All the styles are written from scratch using Sass
